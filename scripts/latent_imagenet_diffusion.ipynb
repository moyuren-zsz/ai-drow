As a rule of thumb, higher values of `scale` produce better samples at the cost of a reduced output diversity. Furthermore, increasing `ddim_steps` generally also gives higher quality samples, but returns are diminishing for values > 250. Fast sampling (i e. low values of `ddim_steps`) while retaining good quality can be achieved by using `ddim_eta = 0.0`."
